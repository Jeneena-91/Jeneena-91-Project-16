    "## Introduction :\n",
    "The telecom operator Interconnect would like to be able to forecast their churn of clients. If it's discovered that a user is planning to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special plan options. Interconnect's marketing team has collected some of their clientele's personal data, including information about their plans and contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interconnect mainly provides two types of services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Landline communication - The telephone can be connected to several lines simultaneously.\n",
    "- Internet - The network can be set up via a telephone line (DSL, digital subscriber line) or through a fiber optic cable.\n",
    "- Some other services the company provides include:\n",
    "  \n",
    "        - Internet security: antivirus software (DeviceProtection) and a malicious website blocker (OnlineSecurity)\n",
    "        - A dedicated technical support line (TechSupport)\n",
    "        - Cloud file storage and data backup (OnlineBackup)\n",
    "        - TV streaming (StreamingTV) and a movie directory (StreamingMovies)\n",
    "\n",
    "The clients can choose either a monthly payment or sign a 1- or 2-year contract. They can use various payment methods and receive an electronic invoice after a transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem Statement :\n",
    "Interconnect wants to forecast the client churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Value :\n",
    "Interconnect wants to forecast client churn in order to proactively retain customers by offering promotions or customized plans."
